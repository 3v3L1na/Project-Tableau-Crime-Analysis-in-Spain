# Crime Analysis in Spain 🇪🇸🔍
In today's complex social landscape, understanding and analyzing crime patterns is fundamental for the safety and well-being of the society in which we live. Therefore, our company Crime Hunters has dedicated itself to conducting a comprehensive analysis of official crime data in Spain.

**🎯 Our objective**: To provide a clear and detailed overview of the crime situation in Spain, differentiating by type of crime, sex, and geographical location, with the aim of supporting informed decision-making in the prevention and fight against crime.

In this project, we explore, transform, and visualize official data, seeking significant patterns and trends to offer relevant conclusions about criminality in Spain.
